* The Summit Defi ecosystem will be enabled and farming will begin.
* **OASIS farms** will be available immediately.

## Day 0 - Top of the Hour

Following Launch, at the next top of the hour \(ex: 3:37pm launch --&gt; **4:00pm next top of hour**\):

* **PLAINS farms** will become available for farming with 2 totems and 2 hour rounds.

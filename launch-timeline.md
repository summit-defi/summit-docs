* **Every Weekend, **an EXPEDITION will be created from deposit fees and passthrough strategy rewards. The Expedition will have 3 rounds, the first opening on Thursday, and the final closing on Sunday.
* **Once Monthly**, a boosted EXPEDITION will be created with a much larger pot and potential winnings.

# Bug Bounty

![](../.gitbook/assets/bug-bounty-masthead.jpg)

Though our codebase has been audited by Obelisk, and thoroughly tested with a rigorous testing suite, no code is perfect.

If you find any bugs in the Summit DeFi contracts, please immediately bring it to our attention.

**We offer tiered bounties for different bug severity levels, and plan to be extremely fair with the payouts.**

To submit a bug for bounty, please DM Architect on Discord:  
`Architect#6339`

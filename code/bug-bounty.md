# Bug Bounty

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Bug Bounty Masthead.jpg>)

Though our Smart Contracts have been audited by Obelisk, and thoroughly tested with a rigorous testing suite, no code is perfect.

If you find any bugs in the Summit DeFi Contracts, please immediately bring it to our attention.

**We offer tiered bounties for different bug severity levels, and plan to be extremely fair with the payouts.**

To submit a bug for bounty, please DM Architect on Discord:\
`Architect#6339`

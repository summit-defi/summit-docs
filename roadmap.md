# Roadmap

![](.gitbook/assets/roadmap-masthead.jpg)

OK so it's not actually a roadmap: it's a to-do list. Times stated are estimates, however we will clearly communicate if there is a change.  
  
We are committed to making SUMMIT a lasting player in the Defi world. We have put too much work in to be happy with the standard 1 month birth & death cycle of yield farms, so take a look below to see what our future holds.

### Early Q4 2021

* [ ] Launch summit on Fantom Opera \(see launch timeline\)

{% page-ref page="launch-timeline.md" %}

* [ ] Reach out for partnerships with established players \(already begun\)
* [ ] Standard token listings \(coingecko / CMC\)
* [ ] Grow socials presence, partnerships and giveaways

### **Late Q4 2021 / Q1 2022**

* [ ] Create Summit NFTs \(more info coming soon\)
* [ ] Create NFT marketplace page of summit.defi
* [ ] Create NFT based profiles, integrate NFTs into tokenomics

# Everest Token

**EVEREST allows you to take part in daily Expeditions and to contribute to decisions on the SUMMIT ecosystem. This will eventually be the DAO currency of the Summit DeFi ecosystem.**

### **THE EVEREST TOKEN ITSELF**

**EVEREST** can not be traded or bought.  It can only be created by locking Summit for a period from 1 month to 1 year.  The longer you lock the more Everest you get.   **However, to recover your Summit you must trade your Everest back in!**&#x20;

Your EVEREST token entitles you to Expedition rewards, farm SUMMIT, join exclusive pools and participate in decision making for the project through our DAO.&#x20;

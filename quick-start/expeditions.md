### What are Expeditions?

Welcome to Expeditions. This is what it's all been building up to, where diamond hand SUMMIT holders reap the rewards beyond farming and winning our wonderful token.

While you have been having fun risking your yields and winning the yields of others, rallying your totems, and increasing your bag of SUMMIT, your assets have been hard at work all week earning yields and filling up the Expedition prize pot.

**Every weekend we have three Expedition draws - Friday, Saturday and Sunday where the entirety of the prize pot is distributed to winning SUMMIT holders.**

To play and be in with a chance of winning this mammoth prize you simply pledge SUMMIT into the Expedition before the round winner is drawn. When you pledge you will have to pick a Cosmic Deity - **The noble BULL or trickster BEAR.**

If your deity wins then congrats, you have won a share of the total accumulated Expedition prize pot based on how much SUMMIT you deposited in to the Expedition.

### Cosmic DEITIES

Expeditions are no simple 50:50. We always want\*\* COSMIC BULL\*\* to win so we have weighted this slightly in his favor. The actual percentage win chance of COSMIC BULL is determined by the previous round, and is always between 50-90%.

Those that choose to side with \*\*COSMIC BEAR \*\*will always have a lower chance of winning, but can potentially reap larger rewards should COSMIC BEAR snag the win.

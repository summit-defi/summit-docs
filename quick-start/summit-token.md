### **THE SUMMIT TOKEN ITSELF**

**SUMMIT** can either be bought by following the links in the frontend, or earned through staking in **Oasis** farms or **Elevation **farms. Elevation farming allows you to further increase your SUMMIT yields by winning not just your own, but other user's staking yield as well.

Any SUMMIT won in Elevation farms vests over the duration of the next round, preventing large sell offs at the end of rounds.

### EXPEDITIONS

Each weekend, **Expeditions** reward holders of SUMMIT with large pots which accumulate throughout the week. Deposit fees and passthrough strategy rewards are used to build these pots, utilizing the full TVL of Summit DeFi to incentivize long term holding of SUMMIT. An entire week's worth of farming with the full TVL of Summit DeFi is funneled into a 3 round expedition, offering massive earning potential to all holders of SUMMIT.\
\
Expeditions are designed as events to reward SUMMIT holders, **allowing you to exponentially increase your winnings over the course of a single weekend. **Expeditions have almost zero opportunity cost if you aren't so lucky, and they will be back the following weekend.

All in all: **The more SUMMIT you own when its time for an expedition, the larger your potential winnings. **

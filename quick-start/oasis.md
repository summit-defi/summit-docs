# Oasis Overview

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Oasis Overview Masthead.jpg>)

**THE OASIS** is ground zero of Summit Defi. Farms at the Oasis function like traditional farms:

* Deposit tokens / LP in the corresponding farm
* Earn guaranteed SUMMIT

The OASIS farms cater to users not wishing to take the risk at higher elevations (PLAINS / MESA / SUMMIT) and always pays out your winnings.

### Balanced Risk Profile

There is zero risk to your yield associated with staking in the OASIS (that's why it's called the OASIS).  By adjusting the amount you have staked in the OASIS vs Elevation farms, you can tailor your risk profile (and reward profile) to your own taste.

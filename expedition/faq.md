# Expedition FAQ & Troubleshooting

## How is the Expedition funded?

50% of Deposit Fees and 92% of Passthrough Strategy rewards are used to create and fund Expeditions.

## Will the Expedition ever run out of funds?

The simple answer is NO. The CartographerExpedition contract \(the one that holds and runs Expeditions\) doesn't allow us to create an expedition without already having funds to cover the entire run of the expedition. Before the expedition is created, it checks to make sure that it can pay out the winnings every round.

Expeditions are run on a set schedule to allow time for funds to accumulate. As long as users are farming with Summit DeFi, the expedition will be running strong.

## What if I forget to withdraw my funds?

If a round ends and you forget to withdraw your funds, you will automatically be entered in the next round with the same Deity.

This will continue until all rounds of the Expedition ends, at which point you will have to withdraw your funds and winnings.

Finished expeditions with staked funds are visible in the UI for easy exiting.

## Will two Expeditions ever run at the same time?

There is no intentions to run two at the same time. Though it is theoretically possible, the frontend UI is designed with a single Expedition in mind. Of course, this can be changed if demand is there.

## Can the Expedition be used for your IFO?

We're glad you want to work with us, but the Expedition could be a risky way to distribute your funds.  Expeditions disburse huge amounts of funds simultaneously, which could crash the price of a new token.

Having said that, we would be open to running small Expeditions for projects trying to distribute coins.

## Why doesn't the Expedition use Vesting?

1. The winnings from the Expedition are well-established tokens, and less likely to be offloaded.
2. Well-established tokens will not experience severe price swings, so vesting was deemed unnecessary.
3. It's way more fun to withdraw large amounts of stablecoins at once.

## Does the method to choose the 'chance of success' affect the outcome?

The simple algorithm to choose the next rounds chance of success promotes a sense of fairness. The chance of success will _tend_ \(not guaranteed\) to move _away_ from the previous winner.

Though this may seem to make it advantageous to switch Deity after every round, the actual winner of each round is **always** random.

## Will Expeditions cause large SUMMIT price fluctuation around round end?

Perhaps. Expeditions give added value to SUMMIT holders, the price of SUMMIT _should_ increase as the value of SUMMIT increases.

Holders trying to exit may however wait for this bump to trade out, hurting those attempting to buy in _only_ to enter the Expedition.

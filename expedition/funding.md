# How are Expeditions Funded?

Expeditions are funded out of the **Expedition Treasury**. You can think of this treasury as a 'back into the system' fund. **100%** of Tokens in this Treasury are put back into the ecosystem to benefit SUMMIT holders. This treasury grows in **2** ways:

1. **50%** of Deposit Fees go to the Expedition Treasury
2. **92%** of Passthrough Staking Rewards

## The Expedition Treasury

As it grows, the Expedition Treasury will be composed of multiple token and LP types coming from Deposit fees and Passthrough Strategy rewards.

Once daily, the following maintenance of the treasury will occur:

* Earned LPs in the Expedition Treasury will be broken.
* All funds will be converted into stablecoins to insulate against the market.

If we notice too many traders arbitraging against our buying process this will change, but rest assured, the aim is to maximize the amount of funds in the expedition.

## Deposit Fees

Non-SUMMIT farms may feature a deposit fee ranging from 0.0% to 2%. This deposit fee is split evenly, with 50% going to the dev fund, and 50% sent to the Expedition accumulator address.

## Passthrough Strategy Rewards

Funds passed through to Vault-style and MasterChef-style contracts will automatically send 92% of rewards to the Expedition Fund address, and 8% \(mirroring block rewards\) to the Dev Fund.

## Alternate uses of the Expedition Treasury

SUMMIT is an inflationary token, and the Expedition Treasury can be used to perform deflationary **Buy & Burn** events.

Buy & Burn is **not** the primary intention of the fund, and it will be publicly announced once a burn has happened.

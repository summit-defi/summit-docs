# The Expedition

![](<../.gitbook/assets/expeditions-overview-masthead (1).jpg>)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Expeditions test your risk tolerance in a 3 round gauntlet every weekend (3 x 24 hour rounds Friday through Sunday), rewarding holders of SUMMIT (or SUMMIT-FTM LP) with large amounts of stablecoins and other high value tokens.**

_Choose your** Cosmic Deity.**_\
_Pledge your **SUMMIT **stack._\
_Let the **Gods** decide your fate._
{% endhint %}

## But what _IS_ an Expedition?

Put simply, Expeditions add intrinsic value to the SUMMIT token. Over the course of a week, our entire TVL goes to work, earning funds to build pots that are won by holders of SUMMIT. \
\
**At the end of the week, an Expedition distributes these pots back to SUMMIT holders, with a touch of risk thrown in because we are still Summit DeFi.**

For Example:\
Light hearted users may withdraw and sell their SUMMIT, but their staked amount had already earned passthrough rewards which seed the Expedition pot.\
Stronger-handed holders of SUMMIT can then earn those rewards in the next Expedition.\
\
**Expeditions transfer opportunity cost from the impatient to the patient.**

## Staking in Expeditions

> Expeditions have a 24 hour **pledge window** when you can deposit your SUMMIT tokens or SUMMIT-FTM LP.\
> At the end of the 24 hour window, the Expedition **round closes.**\
> ****Your pledged amount at the time of round close is your **participation amount.**\
> **Win or Lose**, your pledged tokens are still yours.

SUMMIT or SUMMIT-FTM LP does not need to be pledged in Expeditions for the entire duration of the round however; for you to be part of the expedition then your funds **must **be in there before the round closes. Your winnings are determined only by the amount pledged when the round ends. Each 'round' of an Expedition has a 24 hour staking window to add your funds.

Expeditions use this style of staking for many reasons, here are a few key examples:

1. You can pledge your funds in at any point before the round closes (so you can sleep, go afk, etc) and trust that you wont miss out on the action.&#x20;
2. Min/maxing users can stake SUMMIT/LP mere minutes before the round closes, win or lose, and get back to farming immediately after the round closes, minimizing down time.

**To pledge in an Expedition you must choose a Deity (think god-totem), take a look here for more information on Deities:**

## Winnings

The pot is split amongst the users represented by the winning Deity.

A user with 0.5% of the SUMMIT pledged with their Deity is awarded 0.5% of the total pot for the round.

Winnings are available for withdrawal **IMMEDIATELY, **and **DO NOT** need to vest as in Elevation Farms.

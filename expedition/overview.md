# The Expedition

![](../.gitbook/assets/expeditions-overview-masthead%20%281%29.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Expeditions test your risk tolerance in a 3 round gauntlet every weekend \(3 x 24 hour rounds Friday through Sunday\), rewarding holders of SUMMIT with large amounts of stablecoins and other high value tokens.**

_Choose your **Cosmic Deity.**  
Stake your **SUMMIT** stack.  
Let the **Gods** decide your fate._
{% endhint %}

## But what _IS_ an Expedition?

Put simply, Expeditions add intrinsic value to the SUMMIT token. Over the course of a week, our entire TVL goes to work, earning funds to build pots that are won by holders of SUMMIT.   
  
**At the end of the week, an Expedition distributes these pots back to SUMMIT holders, with a touch of gambling thrown in because we are still Summit deFi.**

For Example:  
Light hearted users may withdraw and sell their SUMMIT, but their staked amount had already earned passthrough rewards which seed the Expedition pot.  
Stronger-handed holders of SUMMIT can then earn those rewards in the next Expedition.  
  
**Expeditions transfer opportunity cost from the impatient to the patient.**

## Staking in Expeditions

> Expeditions have a 24 hour **staking window** when you can deposit your SUMMIT tokens.  
> At the end of the 24 hour window, the Expedition **round closes.**  
> Your staked amount at the time of round close is your **participation amount.  
> Win or Lose**, your staked SUMMIT is still yours.

SUMMIT does not need to be staked in Expeditions for the entire duration of the round. Your winnings are determined only by the amount staked when the round ends. Each 'round' of an Expedition has a 24 hour staking window to add your funds.

Expeditions use this style of staking for many reasons, here are a few key examples:

1. You can put your funds in at any point before the round closes \(so you can sleep, go afk, etc\) and trust that you wont miss out on the action.
2. Min/maxing users can stake SUMMIT mere minutes before the round closes, win or lose, and get back to farming immediately after the round closes, minimizing down time.

**To Stake in an Expedition you must choose a Deity \(think god-totem\), take a look here for more information on Deities:**

## Winnings

The pot is split amongst the users represented by the winning Deity.

A user with 0.5% of the SUMMIT staked with their Deity is awarded 0.5% of the total pot for the round.

Winnings are available for withdrawal **IMMEDIATELY,** and **DO NOT** need to vest as in Elevation Farms.

# The Expedition

Expeditions test your risk tolerance in a 3 round gauntlet every weekend, rewarding holders of SUMMIT with large amounts of stablecoins and other high value tokens.

1. Choose a COSMIC DEITY to represent your bet
2. Stake SUMMIT any time before the round closes.
3. Either bask in glory or fall in ruin.
4. Try again 24 hours later.


## Cosmic Deities

Titans fight above to guide the Sherpa's expedition. Untold riches are the reward for a successful search. 

Cosmic Bull guides the way, leading the Sherpa to glory.

Cosmic Bear deceives, distracts, and creates false treasure.

If the Sherpa is successful, the treasure is distributed to Cosmic Bull. If not, it is stolen by Cosmic Bear.

## Expedition Round

- Each round of the Expedition lasts 24 hours, and has a different chance of success (Cosmic Bull win), between 50 and 90%.

- The total pot for the round is static and visible the entire round.

- The chance of success is known, but the result is still random. 

- The Expedition is unlocked for the entire 24 hour round before the winner is randomly chosen. Users can stake and withdraw freely in this period.

- At the end of the 24 hour round, the staked SUMMIT of each user is considered their _"BET"_ (though the bet SUMMIT is never put at risk).

## Winnings

The pot is split among the users represented by the winning Deity.

A user with 0.5% of the SUMMIT staked with their Deity is awarded 0.5% of the pot.

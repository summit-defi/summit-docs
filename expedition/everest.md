# Everest

## Everest, the true Expedition

We are in the process of building a brand-new system to further improve the utility of SUMMIT, improve the Expeditions and how it potentially interacts with the Summit DeFi protocol as a whole.&#x20;

Everest will be the Summit DeFi governance token, with some extra bonuses.&#x20;

This will allow you to stake your SUMMIT or SUMMIT-LP and receive Everest as your receipt. The amount of Everest you receive is based on the current supply of SUMMIT, as well as how long you lock your SUMMIT or SUMMIT-LP for.

### Is there a max supply of Everest?

The maximum supply of Everest is 4 Million, and will be held in its entirety in the Expedition contract where it will it will be awarded to SUMMIT holders who lock their SUMMIT and SUMMIT-LP

### What can I do with Everest?

Everest can be used in two ways:

* You can either use it to farm more Summit through our Yield Multiplying platform
* Stake it in dedicated Everest pools, which use part of the Expedition Treasury to consistently earn you tokens.

### What about joining the Expeditions?

&#x20;While your SUMMIT or SUMMIT-LP is locked, you are automatically entered into the daily Expedition drawings, where you earn a portion of that Expeditions pot if your Deity wins the drawing.

### **How do I earn Everest?**

You earn Everest by locking your SUMMIT or SUMMIT-LP.

* If you lock your SUMMIT-LP you earn Everest at 2x the rate compared to just locking SUMMIT.
* In addition to this, depending on how long you lock your SUMMIT/ SUMMIT-LP for will also give you an increased earning factor for Everest from 1x to 2x.

As an example, if you lock your SUMMIT in for 1 day, it will earn 1x Everest however; if you lock your SUMMIT-LP for a year, it will earn a higher amount of 4 Everest per day as per below:

* 2x Everest for being a SUMMIT-LP
* 2x Everest for the extreme locking period

### What's next?

We are in the process of Everest and its tokenomics. Once completed, our developers will submit the final smart contract to be audited before releasing it.

We will continue to update this section on Everest to include more information as we progress through its development.

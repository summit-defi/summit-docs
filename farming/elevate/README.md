# Elevate Funds

"Elevating" Funds is part of our mission to create a frictionless and mature experience for users. 

> Elevating funds transfers funds directly from one elevation to another, without separate withdraw / deposit transactions, and without paying any additional fees.

Elevating is possible through each networks bscscan equivalent. Source and destination pools are validated to have the same token and be elevate eligible.

## FAQ:
------

## When can I elevate funds?

You can Elevate funds at any time from any farm to a matching farm at a different elevation.

## Can I elevate into the Expedition?
Of course, SUMMIT can be transferred directly from a farm and back without slowing down your farming.

## Do I lose my winnings if I elevate?
Elevating will attempt to harvest any winnings in both the source and destination pool. Any already vested funds will be harvested, and funds still vesting will continue to do so.

## Are my funds actually moved?
They actually are not touched at all. Funds management is always completed in the Cartographer, so no movement needs to happen at all. Both farms are simply updated with the amount elevated.

## How does Elevating work with Passthrough?
Passthrough Strategies are on a per token / lp basis, so just like for the Cartographer, the funds remain in the passthrough strategy, ignorant that they are being moved at all.

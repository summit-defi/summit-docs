# Cross-Compound

![](../.gitbook/assets/cross-compounding-masthead.jpg)

{% hint style="success" %}
**"Cross-Compounding"** harvests the available SUMMIT rewards from any Summit DeFi Token / LP farm, and deposits them directly into the respective **SUMMIT** token farm at that same elevation.
{% endhint %}

The ability to Cross-Compound your winnings as they become harvestable reduces friction and allows users to reduce farming downtime. User's gas is saved by replacing two transactions to accomplish a compounding task with a single one.

If the source and destination farms are Elevation Farms, the SUMMIT farm will have the same Totem as the source farm.

## FAQ:

## Can vesting winnings be Cross-Compounded?

Only the already vested and harvestable rewards can be cross-compounded. You can cross-compound at the end of the vesting period to transfer all winnings.

## Can I Cross-Compound to a different elevation?

Cross-Compounding is only designed to work within a single elevation. To move winnings to a separate elevation you can either:

1. `cross-compound -> elevate SUMMIT to target elevation`
2. `harvest -> deposit SUMMIT in target elevation`

## Can I Cross-Compound a SUMMIT pool?

Of course, I suppose you would call it regular compounding, but it'll work regardless.

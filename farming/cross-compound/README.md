# Cross-Compound

"Cross-Compounding" rewards is a frictionless function to make harvesting rewards smoother and more intuitive. 

> Cross-Compounding harvestable SUMMIT automatically determines the destination SUMMIT farm at the same elevation as the source farm, harvests your winnings, and stakes them in the SUMMIT farm.

Cross-Compounding allows compounding winnings from any Summit Defi farm, even if you've never staked in the SUMMIT pool directly.

If the source and destination farms are Elevation Farms, the SUMMIT farm will have the same Totem as the source farm.

Elevation farming is the cornerstone of Summit. Elevation Farms are built around Yield Gambling, a new way of interacting with your farmed Yield, and potentially multiplying it massively.

Elevation farms are built to bring excitement, tension, and community \(through totems\) to the DeFi space. Additionally the progressive round times , progressive average yield, and vesting allows Elevation farms to help regulate SUMMIT price fluctuations.

## What are "Elevation Farms" and "Yield Gambling"?

When staked in a Standard \(i.e. Oasis\) Farm, rewards are generated continuously and can be harvested freely, as you'd experience in any old DeFi farm.

**Elevation Farms differ in that rewards are instead accumulated over the duration of a round, to be gambled against each other at the end of fixed duration rounds.**

Farms are divided into totems, the number of which vary by elevation.  Over the course of a ‘round’ \(either 2h, 4h, or 8h depending on elevations\) the staking rewards of each totem at each elevation are gathered together in one pot.  One of the totems is randomly selected as the winner, with that totem earning the total staking rewards accumulated during that round.

Regardless of win or loss, your staked funds are always safe and available to you, and will continue to build your yield for gambling in the next round.

**Like the OASIS farms, Elevation farms utilize** [**passthrough staking**](../../summit-token/passthrough.md) **to maximize the value of your staked tokens and LP.**

### **Key Points of Note**

* You can stake at any point during a round. You will immediately begin accumulating your **yield** \(the yield part of yield gambling\) as soon as you stake. The earlier in a round you stake, the higher your gambled yield, and the higher your potential winnings. 
* **60 seconds** before the end of the round, the farm will lock. During this time the winning totem is selected and the round finalized. 
* At the end of the round, your selected **Totem** will either win or lose. If you win, your winnings will **vest** over the duration of the following round. 
* You can harvest your winnings as they become available at any point in time. Alternatively you can wait until they completely vest to withdraw in a single transaction. 
* **You do not have to re-stake your tokens / LP every round, you will automatically roll-over to the next round and start generating new yield to gamble.**

## The Elevations

Elevation pools exist at various elevations, each with their own risk/reward profile.  __At higher elevations, the risk gets larger, but the reward grows to match:

| Elevation | **Allocation Boost** | Totem Count | Chance Of Win | Multiplier on Win \(est\) | Round Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The OASIS\* | 100 | 1 | 100% | 1X | Continuous |
| **The PLAINS** | 110 | **2** | 50% | **2X** | 2 Hours |
| **The MESA** | 125 | **5** | 20% | **5X** | 4 Hours |
| **The SUMMIT** | 150 | **10** | 10% | **10X** | 8 Hours |

_\*The OASIS is added only for comparison since it is not an elevation farm and does not feature yield gambling._

\_\_[Higher elevations are unlocked a few days after launch on chain, see launch timeline.](../../launch-timeline.md)

## Progressive Elevations

A new elevation unlocking is meant to be purely a positive for the userbase. To ensure this, the progression of elevations is mathematically guaranteed to yield more rewards over a long enough time span, and moving to the new elevations is designed to be as frictionless as possible.



## Allocation Boost

Higher elevations offer higher rewards, not just through the possible **Winnings Multipliers** from gambling, but through the higher **Allocation Boosts**. A higher elevation farm of token XYZ will _always_ have a higher SUMMIT reward emission than a lower elevation farm.

> `Emission is determined on a PER TOKEN/LP basis, thus all farms of a token across elevations will share a single emission allocation. That allocation is further split by the staked amount at each elevation, adjusted for the allocation boost as you rise in elevation.`

100 tokens staked at **The SUMMIT** will earn the same share of the token's allocation as 150 tokens staked at **The OASIS**.

## Gambling for a Good Cause

Higher elevations have longer round durations, meaning it takes longer on average to 'break ahead' of RNG fluctuations. Users are expected to remain in higher elevations for longer durations to accumulate their yield bets and earn large rewards.

Longer round durations and longer time spent in the pool provides a delayed buffer on price fluctuations, adding stability to the SUMMIT token's price.

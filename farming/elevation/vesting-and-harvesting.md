# Vesting and Harvesting \(Todo - Screenshots\)

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Vesting requires your winnings to mature before you can withdraw them.

**Winnings Vest over the duration of the following round at the elevation they are won at.**
{% endhint %}

## Why do we use Vesting?

Every 8 hours a round ends at the SUMMIT elevation. Along with it, the MESA round and PLAINS round will also end \(the round timers line up\). At that point, **hours** worth of SUMMIT token emission are won by users.

**If this much SUMMIT token became available all at once, users would rush to withdraw their winnings and sell their SUMMIT. Effectively a run on the bank.**

Vesting prevents frequent SUMMIT token price crashes by slowly letting winnings become available for harvest.

## Harvesting Winnings

1. **Wait for some \(or all\) of your winnings to Vest:**
2. **Use the `Harvest` button to withdraw available winnings:**
3. **OR - Use the `Cross-Compound` button to harvest your winnings directly into the SUMMIT token farm at the same elevation: \(more info on cross-compounding** [**here**](../cross-compound.md)**\)**

{% endhint %}

## Referral Rewards

For each friend you refer, you get a **1% bonus of all SUMMIT** _**they**_ **earn**. There is no limit to the number of people you can refer to Summit DeFi, so share your wallet address far and wide.

Additionally, get a **1% bonus of all SUMMIT** _**you**_ **earn** when you add the address of the user that referred you to Summit DeFi.  


### Referring, and being Referred

To enter a friends referral address_**\***_, simply copy/paste their wallet address into the `Referrals` page on summit.defi. 

To refer your friends, send them your wallet address_\*_, and direct them to the same page as above. There is no limit to the number you can refer.

**It's that easy, you will each begin earning bonus SUMMIT as you farm and harvest.**  


### Claiming your Rewards

Any bonus SUMMIT amount you have accrued is shown in the `Referrals` tab of summit.defi.

To claim your rewards _\(watch out for the burn described below\)_ simply click on the  
`CLAIM REFERRAL REWARDS`   
button and complete the transaction.  


### _\*Referral Address Rules_

_Can't refer yourself  
Can only be referred by one user  
No reciprocal referrals - Can't refer the user that referred you  
No 3 user cyclical referrals - Same as above, but with 3_



## Weekly Unclaimed Rewards Burn

{% hint style="warning" %}
**7 days after the Summit DeFi launch \(and every week after that\),  
ANY AND ALL unclaimed referral rewards are burned.**
{% endhint %}

**This means that if you don't claim your referral rewards before a burn happens, you will lose that bonus SUMMIT.**

This burn ensures that the true amount of summit in the ecosystem is accurate, without forcing users to check back too frequently or lose rewards.

You can see the countdown timer until burn in the `Referrals` tab of summit.defi. ****

## FAQ:

## Where does the bonus SUMMIT come from?

2% of all SUMMIT minted for farm rewards is set aside to be given out as referral rewards. This 2% is the upper bound of all possible referral rewards.

At the end of a 7 day window, any of the 2% bonus SUMMIT minted that hasn't been allocated as rewards _and ****_claimed by users **will be burned**.

## What if I forgot to claim my referral rewards?

Unfortunately there's nothing to be done. That SUMMIT has been burned, and it is lost forever.

## What about a 4 user referral cycle?

_Cheeky. Yes, if you're thirsty enough, you could technically create a 4 user referral cycle all by your lonesome._ 

However, head to our Discord to find friends and make that 4 user friendship circle a bit more of a reality!

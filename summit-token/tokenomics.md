# Tokenomics

## Overview

SUMMIT is the primary token of the Summit DeFi ecosystem, it is earned through farming or by swapping at the designated exchange.

We have designed the Summit ecosystem to give as much value as possible to the SUMMIT token, and will be continuing to add new features that bring additional value in the future.

## Emissions and Fees

_**The emission rate of SUMMIT is 0.25 / second.**_\
_\*\*\*\*(\~650k tokens a month. We view this as a reasonable amount of inflation for our yield farm)_

_**There is no max supply of SUMMIT.**_

**92%** of the block rewards are distributed as farming rewards to pools

> Of that **92%**, **2% **is reserved for referral rewards. Every **7 days** any unclaimed referral rewards will be burned. Be sure to claim any available referral rewards before this burn, or they will be lost forever

**8%** of the block rewards are sent to the **Treasury**

Block rewards are subject to change, and will fall after a suitable amount of time to prevent runaway inflation.

## **The Weak-Hands Pseudo-Tax**

SUMMIT is **NOT** a reflective token, however the ecosystem is designed to return value to the SUMMIT holders in a delayed fashion thanks to **Expeditions**.

Expeditions are funded with 50% of Deposit Fees, and 92% of passthrough strategy rewards. In practice, this means that users are given the opportunity to 're-earn' 50% of their deposit fees, as well as the rewards that they(and others) would have otherwise earned by staking with another system.

Weak-handed users will exit Summit Defi early, losing their ticket to large Expedition payouts. Despite their early exit, they have already seeded future Expeditions. Their staked funds will be put into passthrough strategies during their staking duration, and any deposit fees paid will also be contributed.

This gives the opportunity for other investors, those who outlast, to earn the delayed rewards of the previously mentioned weak-handed users.

**By participating in the Expeditions, lasting SUMMIT holders earn a disproportionally larger share of the passthrough strategy rewards and returned deposit fees that would otherwise have been earned by earlier exiting users.**

## **Lasting Value**

Yield Multplier was designed with a sustainable SUMMIT token in mind. To increase the longevity of the SUMMIT token, higher elevation farms are given an **allocation boost** to incentivize users to move their staked tokens / LP to higher elevation.\
\
Higher elevations are mathematically guaranteed to \_always \_pay out more SUMMIT than lower elevations and oasis farms. Higher elevations feature longer rounds, and a decreased chance of win. Together, these features encourage a longer stay at a higher elevation to consistently break ahead of randomness.

> For example:\
> At the PLAINS, users can expect to win 50% of the time, meaning that after 2 rounds (4 hours total), users can reasonably expect to break ahead of OASIS farms.\
> However, at the SUMMIT, users can only expect to win 10% of the time (though they can expect to win 10X), meaning that it will take 10 rounds (80 hours total) to reasonably expect to break ahead of OASIS farms.\
> **Of course these expected times to break ahead do not take into account the allocation boost, which will reduce these times.**

## Reduced Price Fluctuation

All SUMMIT rewards paid out by farms feature \*\*Vesting. \*\*This means that although a user may have won a large sum of SUMMIT, those winnings will become available over the duration of the next round. Vesting prevents many hours of SUMMIT becoming available simultaneously, which would encourage a race to harvest and swap, potentially inviting bots into the ecosystem to undercut our users.

Higher elevation farms feature longer round durations, ensuring that the larger payouts will also take longer to vest and become available for harvest.

Additionally, increased staking at higher elevation will provide a buffer against rapid price fluctuations of the SUMMIT token. Users will be less willing to withdraw their staked tokens and break SUMMIT LP since these tokens will be actively accruing yield to be risked. Leaving a round early can potentially lose a user a large amount of potential rewards, incentivizing users to ride out the price fluctuations instead of panic sell.

## **Treasury**

Treasury funds will be used for the following purposes:

* **Pay artists for assets and NFTs that will be created.**
* **Pay for audits of future contracts.**
* **Bug Bounty Payouts**
* **Hire moderators for TG and Discord.**
* **Given out as rewards for Twitter / Discord competitions.**
* **Boost vaults to spread awareness.**
* **Partnerships and expanding SUMMIT reach.**
*   **Distributed to Summit Team.**\

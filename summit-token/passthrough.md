#### Passthrough Strategies utilize the full TVL of Summit DeFi to earn rewards, which in turn are given back to SUMMIT holders through weekly Expeditions.

When you stake your LP with Summit DeFi, we immediately _**pass it through**_ to known players in the DeFi world. Many trusted farms and vaults exist alongside Summit, and by utilizing assets staked with us, we can earn rewards that boost the price and value of the SUMMIT token itself.

**The passthrough strategy system is a key piece of the Summit DeFi machinery, and contributes to the "Weak-Hands Pseudo-Tax", as discussed in detail in our Tokenomics page:**

### Passthrough Rewards

Each of the passthrough strategies earn a reward token, and our inbuilt strategies to handle it extracts any earned rewards whenever a deposit or withdrawal takes place. 

**92% of these rewards** are sent to the Expedition Treasury, seeding Expeditions. These tokens will be of all types, and they will be converted into stablecoins daily.

The remaining **8% is sent to the Treasury**, and a breakdown on expenditures can be found above in the Tokenomics page.

### **Deposit Fees**

Some passthrough strategies utilize farms / vaults that have their own deposit fees. If this is the case, our farm will have a deposit fee that covers the passthrough fee, and the passthrough fee will be taken out of that.

**What you see is what you get: A Summit Defi farm that advertises a 2% deposit fee, will only ever take a 2% deposit fee, you don't have to worry about the underlying fees.**
